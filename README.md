Steps to run the App:
1. For Hardhat projects, use the built-in clean command to remove cached compilation artifacts and clear the cache directory:
   npx hardhat clean
2. Compile your solidity contracts.
3. Open a separate terminal window and start the Hardhat local node before deploying.
4. Deploy the contract
5. Change the const CONTRACT_ADDRESS in server.js in Frontend Folder to the address obtained in the step 4.
6. Open a separate terminal window and change to the frontend folder and run the app.
